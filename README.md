#BVA-Auctions SDK

This repository provides sample code to show how to use the BVA-Auctions API.

## Getting started
1. Check out the getting started documentation on: https://api.bva-auctions.com/api/docs/getting-started.html

## Structure
The SDK contains various directories. Each one is for a specific programming language. Inside each diretory, 
a distinction is made between a 'client' and 'management'. The client shows information on how a regular end-user
would use the API, while management shows samples to for instance manage auctions and lots.
